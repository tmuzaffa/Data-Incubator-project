# Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze the energy consumption per household in the city of London as a function of time of the day, weather patterns, public holidays etc. 
The data set was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london/data), which is 1Gb in size. This data was collected by the city of London, after European Union initiative to reduce the green house gas emissions. Due to this initiative, UK government decided to install smart meters in the country. Approximately 6000 households participated in the initial study as aprt of Low Carbon London Project from Nov. 2011 to Feb 2014. 

# Motivation

The motivation behind tackling this data set is to analyze the energy consumption data and the economics realted with energy consumption. This analysis will help us understand the consumption peak hours and how it effects the energy bill and effect the finance of a househod. I will use the weather data, and energy cost data in combinition with the energy consumption data to do the analysis. 

I will also analyze the impact of installation of renewable energy source (such as solar cell) or buying an electric vehicle, and how it effects the energy consumption and costs for a household. Buying of electric vehicle proposes an interesting question, how it would effect overall as the cost of gasoline would no longer influence the finance of the household. 


# Project expected outcomes
* Energy consumption patterns 
* Forecasting the consumption of a household based on previous patterns
* Effect of renewable system installation on energy consumption 
* Purchase of electric vehicle and its effect 
* Installation of upgrading the household device to electric version (such as gas furnace to electric etc. )
* Forcasting if installation of renewable energy source would be financially better option
